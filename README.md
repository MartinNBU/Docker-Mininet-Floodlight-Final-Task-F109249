# Docker-Mininet-Floodlight-Final-Task-F109249
This is my attempt at writing a mininet python script that creates a network with a topology of 419 switches and 19 hosts connected in a linear topology and configure traffic rules between hosts.
Tasks : - Write a sample mininet python script that creates a network with a topology of <419> switches and <19> hosts connected in a linear topology.

- Make your own docker-compose setup in the repo that contains:

    mininet
    floodlight
    Your script

Demonstrate how you configure bidirectional traffic rules between the two most remote hosts in your network with a script to the floodlight api interface.
